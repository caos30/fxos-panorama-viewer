## FXOS panorama viewer

A simple, open-source viewer app that displays a panoramic image sliding it when the phone orientation sensors detect user movement:

- when user move to left/right
- when user mover vertically the phone

It has been tested in FXOS v2.1 (LG FX0), and it will only run on devices with an internal compass.  

The source code is available at the link below.  This is my first FXOS app, so please be kind in any comments!  
Particular thanks to Toolkit app [https://github.com/PG23/Toolkit] for inspiration.
